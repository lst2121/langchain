      "User: Can you explain what Task Decomposition is?\n",
      "Assistant: Sure, Task Decomposition is a technique used in artificial intelligence to break down complex tasks into smaller and simpler steps. This helps the AI system plan ahead and execute each step efficiently. It involves four stages - task planning, model selection, task execution, and result analysis. Would you like me to explain each stage in more detail?\n",
      "User: Yes, please! Can you tell me more about the first stage, Task Planning?\n",
      "Assistant: Of course! In the first stage of Task Decomposition, the AI system uses a language model called HuggingGPT to parse the user's input and identify multiple tasks. These tasks are then assigned attributes such as task type, ID, dependencies, and arguments. The system uses few-shot examples to guide the language model in task parsing and planning. Would you like me to provide an example of how this works?\n",
      "User: Yes, please! Can you give me an example of how Task Decomposition is used in practice?\n",
      "Assistant: Sure! Let's say a user asks for directions to a restaurant. The AI system would first identify the task as \"finding a restaurant.\" It would then break down the task into smaller steps such as finding restaurants in the area, reading reviews, and selecting the best one based on location and cuisine. The system would use Task Decomposition to plan ahead and execute each step efficiently. Would you like me to explain the other stages of Task Decomposition?\n",
      "User: Yes, please! Can you tell me more about the second stage, Model Selection?\n",
      "Assistant: Certainly! In the second stage of Task Decomposition, the AI system selects an expert model to execute on the specific task. The selected model is responsible for generating predictions based on the user's input and the task requirements. Would you like me to explain how this works in more detail?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Consider a scenario where you are working as a Cloud Engineer for a company that uses the Task Decomposition system described above. Your job is to ensure that the AI assistant can handle any possible situation, including those that require the use of multiple models at once. \n",

      "The company has three different language models: Model A, Model B, and Model C. Each model specializes in a specific task type - Task Type 1, Task Type 2, and Task Type 3 respectively. The AI assistant can only execute one model at a time due to resource limitations.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day, the AI assistant receives an input that requires all three models: \"Find restaurants with good reviews.\" \n",

      "1. Model A is currently being used for Task Type 1.\n",

      "3. Model C can only be used if Model A is not in use.\n",
