      "- If there's no correlation between any two variables, it means that these variables are independent of each other. For example, if there's no correlation between 'Temperature' and 'Traffic', it doesn't mean that temperature has no effect on traffic; it just means that in this dataset, there is no relationship between the two variables.\n",
